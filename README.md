# Patches and the Manic Mansion

### Overview
  This game began as part of the Global Game Jam 2019. This is a polished and slightly reworked version of the game being actively worked on by Daniel Freitas.

### Design Goals
  #### • Focus Experience
  The player should know from the start what their goal is and how to achieve it. This will be achieved through the use of on-screen key instructions and a scoring system (even though the score is ultimately discarded for comedic effect).

   
  #### • Reduce Bloat
  There are many changes which can be made to the game that will ultimately reduce the amount of code and complexity of the project. Namely, the random level generation of the original game can be scrapped as the player will likely not play the game more than once after seeing their score get thrown aside as part of a punchline.


  #### • Implement Missing Features
  There were assets made and features planned for the original game which never made it into the final release of the jam version due to time constraints. Some of these were user interfaces, intro and outro music, and restricting player movement to the visible gameplay area.
